emolRTE (Even MOre Lightweight Rich Text Editor)

Yet another unobtrusive and unbloated JavaScript WYSIWYG online editor for jQuery. 

Just a couple of JS files (6.4kb) + pack of 31 icons (11.6kb).

It should work with all major browsers (IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Opera 9+, Safari 3+) and degrades gracefully to textarea field for others.

Needs more testing. Feedback very welcome.
